INTRODUCTION

CLog is a command-line logbook for amateur radio. There is no other
interface available. If you don't like working on a command-line, forget this
software. There's no GUI, TUI or whatever. However, if you can't live without
your command-line, you might love it. At least I do :-)

CLog was originally named Hamlog-CLI, but since lots of ham radio logbooks are
called 'Hamlog' this name would be too confusing. Therefore I renamed it to
CLog.

CLog can be downloaded from http://github.com/pa3hcm/clog.

AUTHOR

CLog is written by Ernest Neijenhuis PA3HCM.

Special thanks to Adrian van Bloois PA0RDA for testing CLog, and providing lots
of ideas on functionality and usability.


REQUIREMENTS

- Perl, including DBI and DBD::MySQL
- MySQL server (3.23.23 or higher) and client

CLog is developed and tested on CentOS 5 (i686), with the included Perl 5.8.8,
perl-DBI, perl-DBD-MySQL and MySQL 5.0.27. However, it should run on most
UNIX/linux platforms. You may have to change the perl path on the first line of
the 'clog' file.


INSTALLATION

When using the RPM, the installation is quite simple:

- Be sure your MySQL database server is up and running.

- Install the RPM:
  # rpm -ivh clog-1.0-1.noarch.rpm

- Run the following command to create the 'clog' database:
  # mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/doc/clog-1.0/clog.sql

- Create your configuration file:
  # cp /usr/share/doc/clog-1.0/example.clogrc ~/.clogrc

- Review the configuration file. You must at least configure the 'mycall'
  variable.


If your system does not support RPM's, follow this procedure to install CLog:

- Download the clog-1.0.tar.gz file.

- Unpack the file:
  # tar xzvf clog-1.0.tar.gz

- Go into the directory:
  # cd clog-1.0

- Copy some files:
  # cp clog /usr/local/bin
  # cp example.clogrc ~/.clogrc

- Run the following command to create the 'clog' database:
  # mysql -u root -p < clog.sql

- Review the configuration file. You must at least configure the 'mycall'
  variable.

- Import the latest cty.dat:
  # wget http://www.country-files.com/cty/old/cty.dat
  # clog import_cty cty.dat

Consider creating a crontab entry for this, e.g.:
  6 6 * * 1 wget http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat ; \
            clog import_cty cty.dat ; \
            rm cty.dat


UPGRADING

A direct upgrade from CLog 0.4b or older is not possible. Upgrade to CLog 0.5b
first, then upgrade to 1.0.

When using RPM's, the upgrade is very easy:

- First install the new RPM:
    # rpm -Uvh clog-1.0-1.noarch.rpm

- Add the following line in your .clogrc file, replace PA3HCM and JO21OX with
your call and locator:
    mycall = PA3HCM
    mylocator = JO21OX

- Upgrade your database (you may have to repeat this step a couple of times
  when you skip multiple versions):
    # clog dbupgrade

- Test your new version:
    # clog list

When NOT using RPM's, you should replace your current clog file with the one
that comes with this distribution. Also, you have to update your database:

  # clog dbupgrade

Since we changed the way of upgrading the database in version 0.6b, some users
may see this error when running the 'clog dbupgrade' command:

  DBD::mysql::db do failed: ALTER command denied to user 'apache'@'localhost'
  for table 'qsos' at ./clog line 822, <CONFIG> line 13.

The problem is that the given user is not allowed to modify the database
structure. To solve this, log in to the MySQL client as root, and run the
following queries:

  # mysql -u root -p
  Enter password: ********
  mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON clog.* FROM 'cloguser'@'localhost';
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON clog.* TO 'cloguser'@'localhost'; 

Now run the upgrade again:

  # clog dbupgrade


SECURITY

When creating the database, a user 'cloguser' is created with the password
'clogpass'. Maybe you don't want these default credentials. Therefore you can
modify the password of this user in the database using the MySQL client:

  # mysql -u root -p
  Password: ******
  mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'cloguser'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('new_password');

Now edit/create the .clogrc file in your home directory (see example.clogrc)
and modify the value for dbpass:

  dbpass = new_password


WORDPRESS PLUGIN

From version 0.11b a simple WordPress plugin is included with CLog. This
plugin allows you to publish your logbook on a WordPress enabled website.
The plugin is a single PHP-script and is named wp-clog.php.

Follow these steps to install the plugin:

- Go to the document root of your WordPress website, e.g.:

  # cd /var/www/html

- Go to the directory 'wp-content/plugins'.

  # cd wp-content/plugins

- Create a directory called 'wp-clog':

  # mkdir wp-clog

- Put the wp-clog.php file in this directory.

- Verify rights are correctly set, e.g.:

  # chmod 0755 . wp-clog.php

- Go to your WordPress dashboard using your favourite webbrowser.

- Click on 'Plugins' in the sidebar.

- Look for 'WP-CLog' and click 'Activate'.

- Click 'Settings', customize the given options and click 'Save Changes'.

To list your QSO's on a page or blog post, include this in your content:

  [wpclog-list]

This will include a table with the 25 latest QSO's. If you want to change
this number, use the 'limit' paramter, e.g.:

  [wpclog-list limit=100]
